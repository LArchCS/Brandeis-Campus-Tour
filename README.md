# Brandeis-Map-Graph-Campus-Tour
This program is a programming assignment from algorithm class. It Implements a walking map utility for the Brandeis campus. The program will ask for a begin location, a finish location, whether using a skateboard, and whether to minimize distance or time.

- ```Construct graph```
MapDataEdges.txt and MapDataVertices.txt store the campus map vertices and edges, and are used to constuct the Brandeis campus map graph.
- ```Data structures```
Data structures implemented include DynamicArray, LinkedList, BinaryMinHeap, PriorityQueue, HashTable, HashMap, Graph (adjacency list), and UnionFind (impletemented using map instead of array).
- ```Algorithms```
Algorithms implemented include QuickSort (sort either on edge length or traveling time), UnionFind, Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and a shortest campus tour algorithrm improves on Minimum-Spanning-Tree generated by Kruskal's and Prim's. However, the Hamilton-Tour is a NP-Complete problem, the shortest campus tour algorithm is an approximation to it.
- ```MATLAB visualization```
Includes files in the \MatlabScriptsToDisplayAPath folder. The main file is Display.m.
- ```Tests```
No test files are uploaded. All data structures and algorithms were tested on my machine before uploading.

## Compile and Run files
Main function is in Map.java. Run the Map.java file, interact with console, and follow instructions to generate campus tour.

## Visualize campus tour
The Map.java will generate a RouteCropped.txt file. Moved it to MatlabScriptsToDisplayAPath folder and run Display.m to visualize the campus tour. Display will read coordinates in RouteCropped.txt and draw lines on BrandeisMapLabeledCropped.jpg.
